Chapter 7 Atherosclerosis 

7.1 Cardiovascular System 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide [1, 2]. Atherosclerosis, the build-up of plaques within blood vessels resulting in restriction of flow and potential risk of rupture, contributes to the development of heart attack (myocardial infarction) and stroke. Angina pectoris, a diagnosis that correlates pain in the chest with reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, is also predominantly caused by atherosclerosis, a key burden of morbidity particularly in the developed world, affecting 19 males and 14 women in every 100,000 of the population in Western Europe [1]. The risk of developing ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke both increases with age [3], and there is a slightly higher risk of developing heart attack, stroke or suffering from angina in men [2–4]. Another important con­tribution to CVD is peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which, although a rare cause of mortality, contributes significantly to the burden of morbidity globally [5]. Our focus in this chapter however will be the role of immunity on atherosclerotic­mediated heart attack and stroke as it is in these areas where much work has been conducted. 
So-called modifiable risk factors for CVD have been identified over many years, resulting from analyses at both a populational and epidemiological level as well as characterisation of risk factors from bench side analysis of genetic mutations to link cause and effect. 
Cigarette smoking has been identified as a key risk factor for CVD. This was particularly noted during the twentieth century following a sharp rise in the inci­dence of smoking followed, several years later, by a noticeable increase in the inci­dence of both lung cancers and death from CVD. Smoking has consistently shown to increase the risk of death from IHD and stroke in longitudinal follow-up studies [6, 7]. The effects of tobacco smoke inhalation on the immune system have been considered for some time [8]. Smoking is thought primarily to modulate immune responses through the lung, where innate immune cells such as alveolar macro­phages and monocytes respond to environmental pathogens in order to prevent for­eign material and pathogens from reaching alveoli. Smoking increases macrophage number and their production of lysozymes and secretion of elastase [9]. Although macrophages isolated from smokers produce higher levels of oxygen-free radicals, they are less able to deal with bacterial pathogens when compared with non-smokers 
[10] suggesting functional impairment [11]. These immunomodulatory effects are not limited to macrophages as alterations in effector function of natural killer (NK) cells [12] and lymphocytes [8]. Immunoglobulin levels are lower in smokers [12]; however autoantibodies are higher [13], perhaps providing an explanation as to the higher incidence of some autoimmune conditions in smokers. The mechanisms of this remain unclear due to the complex composition of cigarette smoke; however tar and nicotine are implied as major contributors to this effect [14]. 
Essential hypertension is defined as an elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure above 70–80 mmHg which has been linked to accelerated CVD [15, 16]. Elevations in SBP form a linear relationship with an increasing incidence of ischaemic heart disease and stroke when adjusted for age [17]. Certainly in the West, it is accepted that blood pressure increases with age. Dietary salt intake is linked to a rise in blood pressure [18] as is body habitus recorded as body mass index (BMI) [19]. Experimental animal models and observa­tions in hypertensive humans have linked alterations in immunity and inflammation with hypertension [20–24]; however, despite these data, no convincing pathophysi­ological link has been accepted [25]. The focus of research has been concentrated on the interaction of immunity with the renal, specifically renin-angiotensin, system in animal work [26–28]. Nevertheless, data has certainly suggested an altered cel­lular phenotype in hypertensive patients. Monocytes have been shown to be preac­tivated when stimulated in vitro with toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) altering secretion of tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) at both protein and transcription (mRNA) level [23]. Increased macrophage and T-cell infiltration into the kidneys is seen in a variety of experimental animal models of renal disease [29–31]. Correlating these findings in experimental models to human disease however requires further work and under­standing. Excellent reviews and updates are available in the journal Hypertension where the role and interplay between immunity, inflammation and hypertension are reviewed [25, 32–34]. 
Cholesterol has been strongly implicated in the development of CVD. This asso­ciation can be traced back to over 100 years ago, starting with the discovery that human atherosclerotic plaques contain cholesterol. This was followed by discover­ies that a high-cholesterol diet can cause atherosclerosis in rabbits and that a feed­back inhibition loop for cholesterol synthesis exists leading to the discovery of a mutation in humans resulting in defective cholesterol transport who were at a high risk of premature death from CVD [35]. 
The terms ‘good’ and ‘bad’ cholesterol refer to different lipoproteins that trans­port cholesterol in the blood. This is however an oversimplification of the complex­ity and differences in attributable risk for these circulating transport proteins. Apolipoproteins produced by enterocytes or hepatocytes with help from hydrophilic phospholipids package hydrophobic lipids such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and triglycerides to make them available for transport, energy delivery or storage. 
The link between total cholesterol levels and the incidence of cardiovascular dis­ease was first suggested in the 1950s [36] followed by the discovery of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as a risk factor for CVD in 1955 [37]. The discovery of its recep­tor in 1973 by Brown and Goldstein [38] leads to the award of the Nobel Prize. This is further discussed in the section titled ‘Lipoproteins’ in more detail below. 
The presence of diabetes mellitus is associated with a twofold increased risk of ischaemic heart disease and stroke as well as PAD [39–41]. Indeed, this risk extends to those with elevated blood glucose levels, often termed ‘prediabetes’ when fasting glucose levels greater than 6 mmol/L were considered [39]. Acute hyperglycaemia correlates with morbidity and mortality in critically and non-critically ill patients 
[42] prompting investigation into potential modulation of immune response. It has been shown to increase monocyte expression of Mac-1 (CD11b) [43] as well as to increase plasma levels of E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), implicated in leukocyte adhe­sion to the vascular wall [44–47]. Hyperglycaemia has been shown to inhibit neu­trophil migration and phagocytosis as well as their ability to produce superoxides for microbe killing [48] and can modulate the cytokine system and complement cascade [49]. 
Diabetes mellitus is a condition defined by chronically elevated blood glucose levels [50] with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) associated with a number of meta­bolic abnormalities. Diabetic patients are at an increased risk of infection [51], par­ticularly susceptible to those of bacterial origin [52]. Studies have identified defects in humoral and cellular innate immunity [53] with defects in monocyte chemotactic and phagocytic profiles [54]. A link between T2DM and obesity has been observed for some time [55–57], sharing the common trait of insulin resistance [58] though a firm mechanism to support obesity as a cause of T2DM is yet to be established. 
Obesity has been described as a global epidemic [59] and is associated with an increase in mortality [60]. Low-grade inflammation is a feature of obesity, with increased circulating levels of TNF-a, IL-6 and CRP [61–65]. Visceral adipose tis­sue is thought to be a driver of inflammation as well as being a driver of insulin resistance [66]. Accumulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells including macrophages [67–69], T cells [70, 71], B cells [72], NK cells [73] and neutrophils 
[74] with a ‘pro-inflammatory’ phenotype along with a reduction in ‘anti­inflammatory’ immune cells (regulatory T cells, M2-like macrophages and eosino­phils) has been shown [66]. 
Combining the evidence presented above, it is reasonable then to extrapolate that the presence of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, dysglycaemia and obesity (specifically centripetal), otherwise termed the ‘metabolic syndrome’, will exert effects on immune cells. In the USA, nearly a quarter of all adults are suspected to suffer from metabolic syndrome and are a predictor of CVD [75]. Activation of the innate immune system is implicated in the development of metabolic syndrome character­istics [76–79]. 

7.2 Cardiovascular Homeostasis 
The cardiovascular system is subject to regulation, through an integrated network of stimuli. Cardiac output is determined by heart rate and stroke volume, which in turn are subject to autonomic, mechanoreceptor, renal, cerebral and endocrine input. Cerebral influence on the cardiovascular system includes regulation via the hypothalamus, utilising the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system to influence heart rate and blood pressure as well as regulation by humoral factors, such as adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline effects on vasculature and cho­linergic effects on skeletal and cardiac muscle. Neurological chemoreceptors can detect changes in partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the circulation causing vasodilation or vasoconstriction to alter mean arterial pressure. 
In this section, we discuss further mechanisms of cardiovascular regulation and the susceptibility for disease when imbalance occurs. 
7.2.1 Lipoproteins 
As described above, much evidence from genetic and clinical trials (predominantly trials where statins have been used to lower cholesterol) now points towards the link between cholesterol and cardiovascular disease. In particular changes in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol successfully lowered with statin therapy have demon­strated significant reductions in mortality from myocardial infarction and reduction in ischaemic stroke [80–91]. Other lipoproteins involved in the regulation and trans­port of cholesterol and dietary lipid and their relative contributions to the burden of CVD are discussed here. 

7.2.2 LDL Cholesterol 
Mounting clinical evidence has implicated elevated total cholesterol levels in early CVD [92], whilst a reduction in heart attack and the need for revascularisation thera­pies and stroke have been shown when therapies successfully lowering LDL choles­terol levels are employed [91, 93]. Twenty-one trials comparing statin therapy to control in the meta-analysis by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ (CTT) Collaboration [91] showed a reduction of LDL-C by 1.0 mmol/L equated to a reduc­tion in heart attacks by nearly 25% (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.73–0.79). Interest in the oxi­dised form of LDL in the context of atherosclerosis was developed following observations that macrophages readily accumulated cholesterol esters in vitro [94, 95], and this led to the concept that modification of LDL is felt to play a key role in atherogenesis [94, 96, 97]. The role of oxidised LDL in CVD has since gained consid­erable momentum as has their interplay with macrophages and the formation of cho­lesterol-loaded macrophage foam cells [98–103]. Oxidised LDL has been shown in vitro to have a pro-inflammatory effect on monocytes [104–106], driving polarisa­tion to macrophages [107] and enhancing anti-microbial response [108]. It has recently been shown that circulating monocytes can, in certain conditions, such as postprandial lipaemia or exposure to non-HDL lipoproteins, also accumulate intracel­lular neutral lipid [109–111]. The biological relevance or fate of these so-called foamy monocytes however remains unclear. Circulating levels of oxidised LDL may also be increased in CVD [100, 112], the relevance of which remains to be fully explored. 

7.2.3 HDL Cholesterol 
Other forms of cholesterol include high-density lipoprotein (HDL) which has been negatively correlated with an increased risk of CVD [92, 113, 114]. The mechanism by which HDL is thought to exert cardioprotective effects includes the ability to remove cholesterol from cells, a process known as ‘reverse cholesterol transport’, and therefore may do this from lipid-laden foam cells [115]. HDL promotes cellular cholesterol efflux mediated by interaction through ATP-binding cassette transport­ers (ABCA1, ABCG1) [116, 117]. 
Beyond this, HDL has also been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects by lowering expression of endothelial expression of VCAM-1, increased production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), reduction in monocyte expression of CD11b and migration [118] and also by downregulating TLR-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages [119]. 
However the relationship has come under question recently, following the use of Mendelian randomisation in patients who had loss of function single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with elevated plasma HDL levels, these patients did not have a reduction of CV events [120, 121]. These findings have been further supported by a failure of clinical trials to correlate raising HDL levels with reduced CV events [122–124], suggesting that HDL function rather than simply plasma level may be important. 

7.2.4 Other Non-HDL Cholesterols 
Chylomicrons represent the largest portion of dietary lipid under transport. Packaged together in the enterocyte, they consist predominantly of fatty acids esterified for transport as triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol and choles­terol esters [125–127]. Following the transfer out of fatty acids to either muscle or adipose tissue, these particles are now termed chylomicron remnants and are cleared by the liver. Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is responsible for the transport of cholesterol and a significant proportion of triglyceride following clearance of dietary lipid by the liver. Work performed in our group has demon­strated that monocyte subsets differentially accumulate neutral lipid in response to VLDL incubation and that this can impair normal cytoskeletal activity and monocyte migration towards an inflammatory stimulus [111] and may also increase endothelial adhesion, although this remains an inconsistent finding [128]. 
Early hypotheses suggested these remnants and indeed the small cholesterol component are in fact contributors to atherosclerotic CVD [129], and interest in this hypothesis has recently been renewed, advocating measurement of non-fasting tri­glycerides as an independent predictor of CV events [130, 131]. The role of the dietary source of triglycerides, importantly whether from saturated fat-rich diets, has recently been an issue of debate. Meta-analyses have called into question the role of dietary guidelines that advocate ‘low-fat’ diets suggesting in fact that the link between saturated fat and CVD is not as clear as once thought [132–134], whilst support remains however for increased intake of polyunsaturated [132] and mono-unsaturated fat-rich diets [135, 136]. 
Other lipid- and lipoprotein-associated CVD risk markers have not been further discussed here due to the scope of the chapter, but mutations in the lipoprotein (a) gene ought to also be considered. 

7.2.5 Central Nervous System 
Beyond the role of circulating mediators, it is now known that the cardiovascular system is subject to regulation from the central nervous system (CNS) and mechanosensors. 
Integrins, for instance, play a key role as mechanosensors in cardiac myocytes 
[137] and may respond to mechanical load in inducing hypertrophy. ß1 integrin has been shown to play a role in combining mechanical stretch in activation of mitogen­activated protein kinases (MAPK) and Rho GTPases [138–140]. ß1 integrin is also known to interact with angiotensin II, a peptide hormone that forms part of the renal­angiotensin feedback loop and can stimulate myocardial contraction [141]. This com­plex field of research is further elaborated in the excellent review by Dostal et al. [142]. 
CNS regulation of the cardiovascular system is primarily through autonomic nervous system alterations of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. Indeed, this is particularly relevant in the context of heart failure [143, 144] and cardiac arrhythmias [145] and was thought of as a potential therapeutic target for resistant hypertension [146], though recent results have allayed early optimism in this [147]. 
The notion that psychological stress can influence the immune system has been considered for some time [148] and evaluated in a variety of ways, where the type of stress has differed (acute or chronic), sequence of stressful events and the differ­ent evaluative markers used to identify an effect on immunity (cell number, cytokine release or a functional assay) [149]. The impact of chronic stress and activation of the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis on haematopoiesis has been studied in both humans and mouse models of atherosclerosis demonstrating an increase in mono­cyte and neutrophil count [150]. In these studies, monocytes increase in number in the peripheral blood [151], and as further elaborated below, their subsets adopt a specific response to acute myocardial infarction that are thought to play an impor­tant role in inflammation following the ischaemic insult but may also play an impor­tant role in tissue repair [152]. Mobilisation from the splenic reservoir [153, 154] and bone marrow [155] contributes to recruitment into infarcted myocardium [156] and may contribute to further risk of atherosclerosis and re-infarction [157]. 


7.3 Immunity in Cardiovascular Homeostasis 
Here we will mainly discuss the role played by cells of the innate immune system on cardiovascular homeostasis and atherosclerosis. We discuss monocytes and mac­rophages and to a lesser extent dendritic cells and granulocytes. We will finish by briefly discussing the role played by lymphocytes. 
7.3.1 Monocytes 
Monocytes are effector cells of the innate immune system. Their involvement in atherogenesis has been suggested for some time [158, 159]. Although previously considered simply senescent cells destined to terminally differentiate into macro­phages following activation and invasion of tissue in response to inflammatory cues, it is now recognised that they may play a much wider role in the immune response. For instance, it is now recognised that they exist in subsets in humans (with murine homologs that have also been studied extensively) [160, 161]. They can be described based upon their relative expression of antigenic markers such as LPS receptor CD14 and Fc.-receptor CD16, further described below. 
7.3.1.1 Monocytes as Heterogeneous Subsets 
In mammals, monocytes can be differentiated into at least two subsets, which can be described as ‘classical’ and ‘non-classical’ monocytes. Classical monocytes are the most numerate, comprising approximately 80% of the circulating number, and are CD14highCD16low , whilst non-classical monocytes, the converse, CD14dimCD16high. A third population of monocytes, termed ‘intermediate’ monocytes, is CD14highCD16high, demonstrating a phenotype somewhere in between the other two, responding strongly to bacterial signals whilst in some also potent viral responses [160]. For instance, clas­sical monocytes demonstrate a rapid and potent cytokine response to bacterial stimuli via TLR-4, whilst non-classical monocytes respond preferentially to viral stimuli via TLR-7 and TLR-8. The relevance of defining and describing monocytes in terms of these subsets is that they may play distinct roles in the context of atherogenesis [161]. Non-classical cells have been described as ‘patrolling’, with evidence they can crawl against the microcirculatory stream, expressing differential levels of chemokine receptors [162, 163] such as fractalkine receptor, CX3 chemokine receptor (CX3CR1) expression [160], implicated in atherogenesis through murine knockout models [164]. 
In mouse models, murine homologs to human monocytes have been identified [160]. Classical monocytes are closest to Gr1/Ly6Chigh monocytes, whilst non-classical cells align with Gr1/Ly6Clow cells. No discernible intermediate homologs are identified, although human intermediate monocytes align functionally with murine classical cells [160, 165] and transcriptionally with non-classical CD16high human monocytes [166]. 
Classical monocytes are preferentially recruited to early atherosclerotic plaques [163, 167]. In the mouse, Gr1/Ly6Chigh populations may give rise to their Gr1/ Ly6Clow counterparts through interconversion in the blood; however this has not been confirmed by human data [168]. Origins of monocyte heterogeneity remain to be discovered. Heterogeneity may exist due to maturation over time and intercon­version between subsets (Gr1/Ly6Chigh to Gr1/Ly6Clow) or NR4A1-dependent matu­ration of individual progenitor cells within the bone marrow subsequently giving rise to heterogeneous subsets or in fact that differentiation is dependent on the local microenvironment and that this promotes differential expression of surface markers and functional phenotype, as shown in macrophage populations [169]. Further dif­ferences in subsets and their potential recruitment to areas of vascular endothelium at risk of atherosclerosis in terms of expression of selectins [170–172], integrins [109, 110, 173, 174] and other chemokine receptors are further elaborated in this review [161]. Monocytes do not necessarily extravasate and terminally differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells and can in fact emigrate from tissue or apoptose [175]. Finally, it should be noted that most of our understanding of monocyte subset biology comes from murine work and that the human model is less well understood. 


7.3.2 Macrophages 
7.3.2.1 Derived from Circulating Monocytes or Tissue-Resident Precursors? 
Macrophages had for some time been considered solely as cells terminally differen­tiated from activated circulating blood monocytes [155]; however this dogma has recently been questioned. Indeed, it is now recognised that most tissues of the body contain resident macrophages, some of which potentially predate the arrival of pro­genitors from the blood in embryological development [168, 176–179]. It is now accepted that most tissue contains resident macrophages that can self-renew inde­pendent of blood monocytes [168]. However some tissue macrophages do require continuous turnover from monocytes, the gut being a good example [180]. Resident tissue macrophages are thought to arise from early yolk sac-derived progenitor cells, bypassing monocytes, or from foetal liver monocytes that themselves have derived from erythro-myeloid progenitors (c-Myb+ cells) generated in the yolk sac and dorsal aortic endothelial cells [181, 182]. Perhaps more relevant to CVD, tissue-resident macrophages that reside in the adventitia of the arterial wall derive from CX3CR1+ erythro-myeloid progenitors from the yolk sac and foetal liver mono­cytes, with subsequent influx of circulating blood monocytes in the postnatal phase accompanied by transient expression of surface receptors associated with adhesion and recruitment of circulating leukocytes [183]. 
Regardless of origin, tissue specificity most likely dictates tissue macrophage func­tionality and a spectrum of phenotypes may facilitate tissue-specific functions, includ­ing atherosclerosis—although that has yet to be well established experimentally [169]. 

7.3.2.2 Role in Atherogenesis 
The retention of apolipoprotein B-rich particles by within areas of the vascular net­work susceptible to atherosclerosis and subsequent engulfment by macrophages can be identified as an important early step in the development of atherosclerotic plaque [184]. Much of the work in identifying these steps have been deduced from murine work, where accelerated atherosclerotic models [185–187] are generated from Ldlr [185, 188] and Apoe [189, 190] knockout mice. Monocyte extravasation into the vas­cular wall [191] as well as the response of tissue-resident macrophages to modified lipoproteins can stimulate both a cytokine response contributing to further leukocyte recruitment and the generation of lipid-laden foam cells, described as macrophages. The role of inflammation and its regulation in atherogenesis and plaque progression, however, is poorly understood [192], and the previous hypothesis of cholesterol uptake by macrophage foam cells causing resultant inflammation has recently been questioned [193]. It is suspected that lipid clearance, through scavenger receptor-mediated endocytosis [194–196], begins as a physiological response of benefit that, following continued exposure to cholesterol without a suitable negative feedback loop, becomes dysregulated with resulting alteration of normal macrophage response [165]. Macrophage foam cells have reduced capacity to emigrate from plaque, thereby contributing to an ongoing inflammatory response, with resulting continued recruit­ment of other immune cells into the plaque [197]. This hypothesis of atherogenesis includes the role played by oxidation of pro-atherogenic lipoproteins [198] and inter­action with proteoglycans [199, 200] in helping to retain them within plaque [200]. Dying macrophages deposit engulfed lipid into the plaque, resulting in a necrotic core that creates an unstable atherosclerotic plaque, implicated in heart attack and stroke, although the process of death may well be a far more complex and regulated sequence of events [201]. 
Unlike in early atherosclerotic lesions, where mouse models suggest a reliance on monocyte recruitment [202–205], mature plaque macrophage replenishment within the vessel wall is primarily through self-renewal [206, 207]. A more recent concept is the role of intraplaque haemorrhage [208] and the role played by macro­
phages that deal with iron overload. Macrophages have previously been referred to as either ‘M1’ or ‘M2’ in an attempt to characterise their presumed responses to inflammatory cues; however this bipolar concept, predominantly described through in vitro and murine gene knockout data, may have oversimplified the true nature of physiological differentiation in vivo where a more complex milieu contributes to final macrophage phenotype [209, 210]. Intraplaque haemorrhage is described as an important aspect of plaque progression and a possible driver of ongoing inflamma­tory cell influx [211]. A Mhem macrophage phenotype is described as protective and deactivated, countering the inflammatory drive of iron overload supporting a M1-type response [211–214]. 


7.3.3 Dendritic Cells 
Like macrophages, dendritic cells (DC) can be defined by their origin with some originating from common precursors in the bone marrow, precursors in the blood or circulating monocytes that differentiate into DCs in the peripheral tissue or athero­sclerotic plaque [163]. Whilst recognised as antigen-presenting cells, they also play an important role in promoting tolerance to self-antigens in part through their induc­tion of regulatory T cells [215]. In mouse models, resident DCs that encounter free cholesterol in the arterial adventitia can accumulate lipid [216]. We will not be elaborating on their role further in this chapter; however a more in-depth description of their potential role in atherosclerosis can be found in the review by Cybulsky et al. [217]. 

7.3.4 Neutrophils 
The most abundant leukocyte in human peripheral blood, neutrophils, is a pro-inflammatory phagocyte and one of the first responders to sites of inflammation, particularly in response to bacterial infection. They rapidly release proteolytic enzymes in order to traverse through extracellular matrix to these sites and further­more degranulate, and this release plays a role in further recruitment and activation of other innate immune cells [218]. The potential role played by neutrophils in both early and late atherosclerotic plaque generation and destabilisation is from data largely extrapolated from mouse models of CVD, and, thus, translation to human mechanistic hypothesis remains to be elucidated. 
Neutrophils are implicated in atherogenesis through their presence in plaque. Staining for surface markers Ly6G and MPO in murine plaque [219] and for CD177 and CD66b in human carotid [220] and acute coronary lesions [221] helps identify their presence here. Furthermore, identification of degranulation proteins in plaque [222–225] and neutrophil accumulation in early lesions in knockout mice [219] in addition to the role of neutrophil granule effects on vascular permeability [226, 227], their potential ability to recruit monocytes to atherosclerotic plaque [228, 229] and possible activation and foam cell formation in macrophages [230] lends weight to their role as important facets to the process of atherosclerosis. Their ability to secrete proteases and transmigrate through extracellular matrix is proposed as a possible model for alteration of atherosclerotic plaque caps [231], the fragility of which is linked to acute arterial thrombosis seen in acute myocardial infarction [232]. 

7.3.5 Lymphocytes 
Whilst macrophages may well account for the majority of inflammatory cells within human atherosclerotic plaques [233, 234], lymphocytes have been found in lesions although less abundantly. T cells constitute approximately 10% of cells in human atherosclerotic plaque with 70% of them CD4+ and the remainder CD8+ [235]. In hypercholesterolaemic knockout mice lacking both B and T cells, the atheroscle­rotic effect was reduced to a degree [236–238]. Conversely, a particular subset of T cells known as regulatory T cells (Tregs) are positive for forkhead box P3 (Foxp3+) and are immunosuppressive cells and may provide an anti-inflammatory role in ath­erosclerotic plaque formation [239]. The role of B cells in atherosclerosis remains elusive and poorly understood. Whilst some mouse work suggests that B cells play a potentially protective role [240–243], some conflicting reports point perhaps to a more subset-specific role as either pro- or anti-atherogenic [244, 245]. The review by Hedrick (ATVB, 2015) [246] summarises in greater detail the potential role played by lymphocytes and NK cells in atherosclerosis. 


7.4 Summary and Conclusions 
In summary we have discussed the pathophysiology of CVD, including established risk factors increasing the risk of premature atherosclerosis; the homeostatic pro­cesses involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular system, elaborating on cho­lesterol transport; and the role of lipoproteins in atherogenesis and reverse cholesterol transport. We have also briefly discussed the role of the CNS and the influence this can exert on both cardiovascular homeostasis and on immunity. The role of the innate immune system (monocytes and macrophages) has also been explored in relation to atherosclerotic plaque as well as the role of DCs and neutro­phils. Finally, for completeness, we have included a paragraph on the emerging role seen for lymphocytes in atherosclerotic CVD. 
In conclusion, the importance of delving further into the individual contributions made by immune cells to atherosclerotic CVD is that they may provide therapeutic targets for treatment of established disease and, perhaps, more pertinently the poten­tial for prevention. Understanding in greater detail the role played by monocytes and macrophages, for instance, in the propagation of atherosclerotic plaque, may provide the ability to develop future therapies that target very specific processes in order to remove or inhibit key steps leading to the establishment of the unstable plaque.
